	<p>Blockchain technology offers the potential to make the world a more transparent, fair, efficient and innovative place. From banks working on upgrading decades-old legacy infrastructure, to NGOs pushing for more transparent supply chains to cryptocurrency startups building financial services for the unbanked, blockchains can be the technological foundation on which that change is made possible.</p>

	<p>But the truth is that today, the blockchain technologies being used today still suffer from core weaknesses that are a becoming an increasing obstacle. Blockchains operate in silos with only limited ability for systems to interoperate, upgradability in decentralized networks is difficult and the scalability provided just doesn’t cut it.</p>

	<p>The Interchain Foundation was founded to solve these problems and bring forth the next generation of blockchain technology. The goal is to build an Internet of Blockchains, where interoperability and scalability.</p>

	<p>With a focus on interoperability and collaboration, the Interchain Foundation is a collaborative effort of two of the most promising blockchain projects: Cosmos & Polkadot.</p>

	<p>Cosmos is a project with an ambitious mission: To create a network of distributed ledgers that will solve long-standing problems in the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities.</p>

	<p>Consisting of many independent, parallel blockchains, called zones, the Cosmos Network allows each zone to interoperate through a shared hub. The Cosmos hub, the first blockchain in the Cosmos network, connects to zones through the IBC (inter-blockchain communication) protocol, keeping a record of the total number of tokens in each zone.</p>

	<p>Cosmos has been built to support a variety of currencies and scripting languages like those found in Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZeroCash, CryptoNote, and more. As all inter-zone token transfers go through the Cosmos hub, you can transfer tokens from one zone to another, quickly and securely and without the need for a liquid exchange or a trusted third party.</p>

	<p>Polkadot establishes a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain public network upon which disparate blockchains can be hosted and communicate with each other.</p>

	<p>The network consists of a relay chain that coordinates consensus and transaction delivery between member chains, or ‘parachains’, and facilitates the finalization of transactions. Parachains plug into the relay chain as validatable, globally coherent data structures, gaining the ability to trustlessly communicate with uniform security.</p>

	<p>Consensus in Polkadot is reached via a Proof of Stake mechanism that utilizes the native DOT network token that functions as an intrinsic proxy for the control, and thus security of the whole network. Because the Polkadot parachain model is so simple, it provides for the possibility of integrating with existing blockchains that already manage their own consensus, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum: Ethereum contracts can “own” Bitcoin, and new parachains can “hold” Ether. Moreover, private and public chains can execute general transactions across.</p>
